Project Summary

############

Development  is considered government aid that promotes and specifically targets the economic development and welfare of developing countries. This concept was adopted as the "gold standard" of foreign aid in 1969 and continues to be a principal source of financing for development aid.

From a Marxist perspective, development is defined as a process that should lead to the economic, social, and political empowerment of a nation or community, aiming for self-sufficiency, equitable distribution of wealth, and the fulfillment of human needs. It involves transforming the economic and social structures to move away from dependency and exploitation, towards a system where the means of production are collectively owned and controlled, and where the benefits of growth and progress are shared by all members of society, not just a privileged few.

Traditionally the effectiveness of development is tracked most commonly by HDI  and GDP.  However this data  tends to be inaccurate and  incomplete. HDI includes indicators like life expectancy, education, and per capita income. However, it doesn't consider factors like income inequality, environmental sustainability, or political freedom, which are crucial for a comprehensive assessment of human development.  In addition HDI ignores inequality and treats everyone in a country the same, ignoring disparities within the population; a high HDI score doesn't guarantee that all individuals in a country have access to basic needs or equal opportunities. 

GDP primarily measures economic output, such as goods and services produced within a country. However, it doesn't consider factors like income distribution, wealth disparities, unpaid work (like caregiving), or the value of natural resources; it  also fails  to take into  account hat growth doesn't necessarily translate into improved living standards for everyone. It can overlook social well-being, environmental sustainability, and other aspects of a good life.  GDP also fails  to realize the negative externalities associated  with  economic  growth such  as things like pollution, resource depletion, or social costs associated with economic activities. These oversights can lead to unsustainable practices that harm the environment and society in the long run.

As you can see In this context,While HDI and GDP provide valuable insights into development and economic activity, they have biases and limitations that can overlook important aspects of human well-being, inequality, and sustainability. In order to properly track “development" we need a much more comprehensive index that takes  into account more nuanced indicators of  quality of life; one that  emphasizes the importance of freeing nations and communities from the mechanisms of capitalist exploitation and imperialism, fostering conditions that enable self-determination, sustainable living, and the holistic well-being of the population.  It  is my goal with this  project to do exactly that. I  hope to  take pre-existing data and coalesce them into  a  more nuanced  index  of  quality of   life;   with the  intention that my study provides more insight into the efficacy of development and  foreign investment. 

This study seeks  to investigate the relationship  between  development and  sustainable improvement in the quality of lives in the places  being  developed. Initially I wanted to analyze multiple  countries within the African  diaspora  of  the  global south from the time period of slavery to  modernization. However,  due to  a  lack of  consistent data  for a  lot of countries, and  the scope of the  project I will limit my research and specifically analyze Jamaica from 1990-2020. This country was chosen because it  has received significant investment by foreign entities, and  as well as maintained a relationship with their former colonizer. While  their relationship to colonialism can be looked upon with criticism and scrutiny (which  it should be) it has allowed for  more data to be collected than in most other places  in the  diaspora .

Fundamentally the problem proposed that this study seeks to investigate is based  on the relationship  between two things  one  being foreign investment/aid  and the other  being quality/standard of  life.  So the question is then raised what  are  the determining factors of both  categories. I will tell you below: 

############

Foreign  Aid/Investment:
Foreign Aid is defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as financial assistance provided by donor countries to promote economic development and welfare in developing countries. This assistance can take various forms, including grants, loans, and technical assistance. The aid is typically provided by governments and is intended for development projects and programs, with the aim of improving the economic, social, and political conditions in the recipient countries. It is intended to be concessional in terms, meaning that it is provided on terms substantially more generous than market loans and often includes a grant element.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to investments made by an entity based in one country into an entity based in another country, specifically targeting a lasting interest and control or significant influence over the management of the foreign entity. This often involves acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock or equivalent of an enterprise. FDI can manifest in several forms, such as establishing new operations (greenfield investments), entering partnerships (joint ventures), or acquiring existing foreign businesses (mergers and acquisitions). The data on FDI includes equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, and other long-term capital, and is presented in net inflows (capital invested in the reporting country minus divestment) or net outflows (capital invested by the reporting country in others minus divestment) (https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/BX.KLT.DINV.CD.WD )(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114954-what-is-the-difference-between-foreign-direct-inve/ )

Quality of Life/ Standard  of living:

############

Quality of life (QOL): is a broad and multifaceted concept that encompasses an individual's overall well-being, including their physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, environmental quality, and spiritual beliefs. It reflects the degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of their life, influenced by both external conditions and personal perceptions.

The concept of QOL is subjective and can vary significantly based on individual experiences and circumstances. For instance, someone with a disability might report a high quality of life, while a healthy individual who has recently lost a job might report a lower quality of life. This subjectivity makes QOL distinct from more objective measures like standard of living, which primarily focuses on economic and material factors. QOL includes emotional and physical well-being, material well-being, and social well-being, highlighting the individual’s perception of their position in life within the cultural context and value systems.

Standard of living: In the context of economics and civilization, the standard of living primarily refers to the level of wealth, comfort, goods, and services available to people in a specific geographic area or society. Economically, it's often measured by GDP per capita, which represents the average income or output per person and gives an indication of the economic well-being of a population. However, this measure has limitations, as it doesn't account for non-market transactions, the distribution of income, or the overall quality of life that includes health, education, and environmental conditions.

Civilization-wise, the standard of living encompasses broader aspects, such as the quality of public services, access to healthcare and education, and the general well-being of individuals and communities. It reflects not just economic prosperity but also societal progress, including cultural, technological, and infrastructural development.
